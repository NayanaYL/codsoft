Simple Rule-Based Chatbot
Introduction
This project implements a simple rule-based chatbot using Python. The chatbot, named SimpleBot, responds to user inputs based on predefined rules using if-else statements and basic pattern matching techniques. This project serves as an introductory example of natural language processing and conversation flow.

Features
Basic greeting and farewell responses
Simple pattern matching using regular expressions
Error handling for unexpected inputs
Continuous conversation loop until the user decides to exit

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Installation
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-chatbot.git
cd simple-chatbot

2.(Optional) Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv chatbot-env
source chatbot-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `chatbot-env\Scripts\activate`

3.Install dependencies:
This project does not have any external dependencies outside the standard Python library

Usage
1.Run the chatbot:
python chatbot.py

2.Interact with the chatbot:

The chatbot will start by greeting you and asking how it can assist you.
Type your messages and see how the chatbot responds.
To exit the conversation, type "bye", "exit", or "quit"

Example Interactions

SimpleBot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
You: Hello
SimpleBot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
You: How are you?
SimpleBot: I'm just a bot, but I'm here to help! How can I assist you?
You: What is your name?
SimpleBot: My name is SimpleBot.
You: Bye
SimpleBot: Goodbye! Have a great day!

Enhancements
Here are some ideas for further enhancing this chatbot:

Implement more complex pattern matching using regular expressions.
Add more diverse and detailed responses.
create a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter or another GUI library.
Incorporate natural language processing (NLP) techniques using libraries like nltk or spaCy.
Implement machine learning algorithms to allow the chatbot to learn from interactions.
